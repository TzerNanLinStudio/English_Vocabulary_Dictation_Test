# English Vocabulary Dictation Test

# 1. Introduction

**This project has completed but this markdown file is still being edited and not all content has been completed yet.**

This project was developed as a side project while I was preparing for the IELTS exam, to help myself review for the test. When I was private tutor, it was also used as teaching material for a university student. The student developed an English interface under my guidance, while mine is in Chinese.

I will briefly introduce the functionality and usage of this software. Everyone is welcome to download and test it from GitHub. If there are any questions, feel free to email me.
