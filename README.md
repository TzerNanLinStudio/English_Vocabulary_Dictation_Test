# English Vocabulary Dictation Test

# 1. Introduction

**This project has completed but this markdown file is still being edited and not all content has been completed yet.**

This project was developed as a side project while I was preparing for the IELTS exam, to help myself review for the test. When I was private tutor, it was also used as teaching material for a university student. The student developed an English interface under my guidance, while mine is in Chinese.

I will briefly introduce the functionality and usage of this software. Everyone is welcome to download and test it from GitHub. If there are any questions, feel free to email me.

The three images above demonstrate the basic functionalities of the "測驗區". Users can select notes from different dates, add new English words, parts of speech, and Chinese meanings to their notes. When users click on the English word field, the system will pronounce the word and display its basic English definition. Therefore, users can save unfamiliar words on this tab-page and review them.

## 2.2. Test Words

(Flowchart will be updated soon)

Users can use this interface to practice dictation, helping them review the pronunciation and spelling of unfamiliar words. (More explaination will be updated soon)

# 3. Future Work

 - Use the Config class to record the parameters required for software operation to ensure that the software's state when opened is consistent with its state when it was last closed.
 - Use the LogRecorder to record the software's running status.
 - Use databases to store unfamiliar words, such as MySQL and SQLite.
 - EEstablish test and GitHub Actions workflows related to CI/CD.
